# Overview of the P3109 Floating-Point Types in Julia

### The P3109 floating-point types in Julia are designed to conform to the IEEE P3109 standard for floating-point arithmetic. This standard defines a set of floating-point types that can represent a wide range of values with varying levels of precision and range. The types are designed to be efficient and easy to use, while also providing a high level of accuracy and reliability.


This package, `FloatsForML.jl`, is the first of three that work together to provide P3109 conformant floating-point types.
