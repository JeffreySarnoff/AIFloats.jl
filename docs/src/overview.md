# Floating-Point Types Consistent with P3109

The [IEEE SA P3109 Working Group](https://standards.ieee.org/iee7e/3109/11165/)
 is drafting a standard for floating-point formats used in machine learning.

Here are floating-point types consistent with the current draft of [The Interim Report](https://github.com/P3109/Public/blob/main/IEEE%20WG%20P3109%20Interim%20Report.pdf).

However, until the IEEE issues the Standard, *there may substantive changes*.
