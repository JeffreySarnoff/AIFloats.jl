a
is there a name for the sequence (K > 2): 1/K, 2/K, .., (K-2)/K, (K-1)/K

If you include 0 and 1, it's usually called a uniform grid over [0,1] with K+1 points.

Uniform Rational Subdivision (excluding endpoints)
It comes from dividing the unit interval [0,1]
into K equal parts and then excluding 0 and 1:
    [0,1] with K+1 points:

Yes! The sequence you're describing is a uniformly spaced sequence of rational numbers between 
1/K .. (K−1)/K, with step size 1/K, excluding the endpoints 0 and 1.

There isn't a widely-used special name for this exact sequence in general mathematical literature, but it's most commonly understood and referred to as:

🔹 Uniform Rational Subdivision (excluding endpoints)
It comes from dividing the unit interval 
[0,1] into 𝐾 (K equal parts and then excluding 0 and 1)
