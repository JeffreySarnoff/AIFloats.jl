# FloatsForML

The [IEEE SA P3109 Working Group](https://standards.ieee.org/iee7e/3109/11165/)
 is drafting a standard for floating-point formats used in machine learning.

"This standard defines a binary arithmetic and data format for machine learning-optimized domains, providing a consistent and flexible arithmetic framework optimized for Machine Learning Systems implemented in hardware and/or software. Having a shared standard improves interoperability.  These formats are designed to be efficient, consistent and highly performant."


Here is the [Julia source code](https://github.com/DiademSpecialProjects/FloatsForML.jl).
