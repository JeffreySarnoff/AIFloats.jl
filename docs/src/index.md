# FloatsForML

The [IEEE SA P3109 Working Group](https://standards.ieee.org/iee7e/3109/11165/)
 is drafting a standard for floating-point formats used in machine learning.

We are defining a family of data formats and providing binary arithmetic optimized for machine learning and related domains. The intent is to provide a consistent and flexible arithmetic framework optimized for Machine Learning Systems that may be implemented in hardware or in software or both combined. Having a shared standard improves interoperability.  The formats are designed to be efficient, consistent and highly performant.


Here is the [source code for this package](https://github.com/DiademSpecialProjects/FloatsForML.jl).
