*this development immediately pertains to binaryKpP, where P âˆˆ {2..K-1}.[^a]*

each finite value in the [nonnegative portion of a] value sequence is a multiplicative composition of three components:
1. a sign bit (0 or 1)
2. a significand (a nonnegative integer in the range [0, 2^P-1])
3. an exponent (a nonnegative integer in the range [0, 2^(K-P)-1])


[^a]: Floating-point value sequences that have no subnormal values are eccentric.
